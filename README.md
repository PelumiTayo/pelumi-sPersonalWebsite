## Reflection

* If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the userâ€™s experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?

I would have incorporated more animation using JavaScript to make the page animated and more visually appealing. I would have liked to do things like using the items on the page as transitions as the page is scrolled. This would make the page more engaging for the user and dynamic. I anticipate I would have to do more research on how Javascript does animations and how to apply those findings into my page.  
* Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?

Accessibility is very important and it is imperative that a website is open and accessible to anyone who has a device, so the notion of website accessibility comes along because no one person is the same. It's important to create an experience that everyone can benefit from. Representation in all aspects of our lives is important, whether racially, systematically, etc... So having web accessibility is another way to show representation. A lack of representation leds to discrimination, whether intentional or unintentional. I chose my specific features because I take in the most information from websites when a traditional style is followed and consistent. I modeled my website to myself, while adding other features that benefit others as well.
